<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. [Qin Jin](https://www.jin-qin.com/). My research focuses on Vision and Language, involving cross-modal generation, video understanding, and automatic evaluation. Currently, I am exploring book-level story evaluation and generation.

[Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with Structured Storyline](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.513.pdf)

**Dingyi Yang**, Chunru Zhan, Ziheng Wang, Biao Wang, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Qin Jin

[**Open Source**](https://github.com/alibaba/alimama-video-narrator) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We explore the task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, generating text to **narrate the ongoing video scenes** and **serve as useful voiceovers.** 
- We release a new benchmark in the advertising domain called E-SyncVidStory.
- We propose an effective framework named VideoNarrator, which simultaneously supports storyline generation and controllable video story generation.

[What Makes a Good Story and How Can We Measure It? A Comprehensive Survey of Story Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14622)

**Dingyi Yang**, Qin Jin

[**Open Source**](https://github.com/DingyiYang/Awesome-Story-Evaluation) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges in evaluating various story generation tasks.
- We analyze standardized criteria, addressing issues of inconsistent definitions and vague expressions.
- We systematically review traditional, LLM-based, and collaborative evaluation methods, highlighting their strengths and limitations in the context of story evaluation.
- We suggest potential future research directions, extending from story evaluation to general evaluations.

[Visual captioning at will: Describing images and videos guided by a few stylized sentences](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3581783.3612263)

**Dingyi Yang**, Hongyu Chen, Xinglin Hou, Tiezheng Ge, Yuning Jiang, Qin Jin

- We explore Few-Shot Stylized Visual Captioning, which aims to generate captions in any desired style, using only a few examples as guidance during inference, without requiring further training.
- We propose an effective framework that handles multiple styles with a single model. It extracts the style representation from stylized samples, and aligns visual information to generate stylized captions.

[Attractive storyteller: Stylized visual storytelling with unpaired text](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.619.pdf)

**Dingyi Yang**, Qin Jin

- We explore Stylized Visual Storytelling, generating stories with complicated styles for image sequences.
- We propose StyleVSG, which applies style-specific parameters to control text style and incorporates a memory module to maintain context coherence.
- To balance style accuracy and visual relevance, we employ multi-task training using our pseudo {images-stylized story} pairs and {images-factual story} pairs.
